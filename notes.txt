Key Differences:
Feature	                  Git	                               GitHub

Type	           Version Control System (tool)	Hosting Platform (service for Git)
Where it Runs	   Locally on your machine      	Cloud-based (accessible via browser)
Purpose	           Tracks changes in code locally	Manages and shares Git repositories
Usage	           Command-line or GUI tool     	Web interface or API
Collaboration      Requires manual file sharing 	Enables seamless collaboration
Internet           Works offline	                Requires internet access




Clone-: Get a repo from github to our local machine
    git clone <get https link from github->code dropdown>




cd-: Change directory to go inside a directory(folder)
    cd.. -: go back to one level folder
    cd / -: go to root directory of the current path
pwd -: Present working directory
ls-: List folders/files
ls -a -: list all files hidden also




Status-: Displays the status of the code
    git status

    1)Untracked-:new files that git doesn't yet track
    2)Modified-: changed
    3)Staged-: file is ready to be committed
    4)Unmodified-: unchanged

Key Characteristics of Untracked Files:

    Not Staged for Commit:
        The file hasn't been added to Git's staging area (via git add).
        Git doesn't include it in commits unless explicitly staged.
    Newly Created:
        Typically, these are new files that have been created in the working directory but not yet added to version control.
    Ignored by Default:
        If a file is explicitly listed in a .gitignore file, Git will also treat it as untracked.

changed(modified)/newfile(untracked files)-->add(staged, any changes(modified or new) have to be staged first then it is ready to be committed)-->commit(unchanged, now git has taken the screenshot of the updated file)




ADD and COMMIT

add-:adds new or changed file in your working directory to the Git staging area
    git add <file-name>  //adds a particular file
    gitt add .  //adds all the files(changed or new file anything)
    (IN GITHUB DESKTOP SOFTWARE THIS STEP IS DONE AS WE CAN SELECT OR UNSELECT CHECKBOXES IN LEFT SIDE OF EACH FILES TO SELECT WHICH FILES NEEDS TO BE READY FOR COMMIT AND WHICH NOT, BY DEFAULT ALL ARE SELECTED)

commit-:it is the record of change
    git commit -m "some message"

EVEN AFTER COMMIT, THE CHANGES WILL NOT BE REFLECTED IN GITHUB, WE HAVE TO PUSH THE COMMIT FOR THAT
push-: upload local repo content to remote repo 
    git push
